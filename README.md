#  Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

You have the option to "eject" at any time if you're not happy about the development tool and configuration choices. With this command, you can decouple your project from the single build dependency.

Instead, all the configuration tools and transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) will be copied directly into your project, giving you complete control over them. With the exception of "eject," all of the instructions will still function, but they will now point to the cloned script so you can edit them. You are on your own terms at this point.

Never use the 'eject' command. You shouldn't feel pressured to adopt the selected feature set because it is appropriate for small and middle-sized deployment. However, we recognise that if you couldn't customise it, the tool wouldn't be very useful the selected feature set is appropriate.
